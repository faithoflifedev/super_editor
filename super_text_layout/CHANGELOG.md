## [0.1.0] - May, 2021

The `super_text_layout` package is extracted from `super_editor`.

 * Introduces `SuperText` widget to render text with layers above and beneath the text
 * Introduces `SuperTextWithSelection` to easily paint text with traditional user selections, 
   which replaces previous uses of `SuperSelectableText` from earlier super_editor work
